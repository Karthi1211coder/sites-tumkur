# Project Overview

The project is a real estate site discovery platform that displays all available properties (sites) from the database based on user-defined filters.

# Goal

The main objective is to collect and showcase site information through two primary sources:

- Agents/Brokers — who can list available sites.
- Customers — who can upload site details directly (this feature will be enabled after the platform gains visibility through social media).

# User Flow

1. Users can search and filter sites based on their preferences (e.g., location, price, size, type).
2. Users can select multiple sites they are interested in visiting.
3. Once selected, the assigned broker/agent will organize a site visit appointment and showcase those sites to the user.
